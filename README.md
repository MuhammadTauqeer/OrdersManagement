I am creating this Web API using Clean Architecture, MediatR, CQRS Pattern, Repository Pattern, and Unit of Work. 
It's not complete; I will update it according to the time I get from my job. 
The Repository will showcase the aforementioned architecture and patterns mentioned, and I will add Authentication and Authorization using JWT. 
The controllers are thinly coded using MediatR. 
This repo contains a larger database than the older order management repo, which used only the Repository Pattern, and will contain more queries and commands to practice DB manipulation. 
The README file will be updated and cleaned as the API nears completion. 
Thank you.
